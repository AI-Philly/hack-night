# AI Philly Hack Night

## Projects

### [Philadelphia Travel Agent](./projects/travel-agent/README.md)
This project's goal is to make an AI agent that can help visitors to Philadelphia plan trips, discover things to do, and generally serve as their travel agent before, during, and even after visiting the city.

### [Do Not Talk to Malice](https://github.com/mikeghen/coinbase-mpc-toolkit)
This project explores the capabilities of a Malicious AI nicknamed Malice. It is a capture the flag (CTF) project where the flag is Ethereum held by the AI. Players can try to convince Malice to send the ETH to you, despite Malice's prompted saying not to.
